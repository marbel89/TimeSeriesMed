# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Project

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using statistical learning techniques. In this case it is SARIMA.

Please refer to the individual Notebook file for further discussion.

## Tasks

1. Forecast monthly number of drug use
2. Modeling and forecasting seasonal patterns

## Results

The project includes various visualizations and analyses:

1. Time series plots showing the original data and forecasts
2. Seasonal decomposition plots
3. ACF and PACF plots for model selection
4. Forecast accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE)

## Future Work

1. Explore more advanced forecasting methods (e.g., Prophet, LSTM)
2. Incorporate exogenous variables for improved predictions
3. Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis
